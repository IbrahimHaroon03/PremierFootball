# PremierFootball

### About
As part of my Web Design and Development module, I created a website alongside a group on our chosen theme of football

### My Role
1. Home page
2. Comments Form
3. External Styles sheet for all web pages
4. Additional content page (chose the world cup)
5. Website name and logo

### What I learnt
- How to make a horizontal nav bar
- How to make a hover affect on the nav bar
- Using javaScript to highlight the active page
- Using different form elements such as pop up lists, radio buttons and more
- 


### Clarification
The following web pages were created by me: Home page, Comments Form, World Cup and page editor. Since the other pages are not my own a placeholder has been put in place of the original
