### About
As part of my Web Design and Development module, I created a website alongside a group on our chosen theme of football

### My Role
1. Home page
2. Comments Form
3. External Styles sheet for all web pages
4. Additional content page (chose the world cup)
5. Website name and logo

### Clarification
The following web pages were created by me: Home page, Comments Form, World Cup and page editor. Since the other pages are not my own a placeholder has been put in place of the original
