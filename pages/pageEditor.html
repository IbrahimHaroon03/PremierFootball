        <h2>Main / Home Page</h2>
        <p>I created a navigation bar with links indicating which page we are currently on using a class and javascript.
            I also made the links appear as buttons when hovered over with the cursor. I also created a main page which
            provides the user access to each students additional content page by clicking on one of the images.

        <h2>Comments Form</h2>
        <p>I created a comments form where the user gave feedback based on their experience with the website. A submit 
            button was also created to collect all the information and email the contents to ourselves. I also made some
            questions required and some optional and changed the styling of the form using CSS.

    <h2>External Style Sheet</h2>
    <p>I defined the basic structure and styling of each page such as the style of the navigation, fonts, color theme and layout
        of text. After explaining and showing the external style sheet to my group i guided them on how to style the pages to maintain
        an overall and consistent theme/layout, whilst also explaining some CSS may need to be changed to better suit there web page.

    <h2>Additional Content Page</h2>
    <p>I created an additional content page on the world cup and implemented anchors throughout leading to various parts of text on the page. 
        The page gave users previously not into football, everything they need to know about the world cup, such as: what it is, how it works,
        when the last world cup was etc.

    <h2>Page Editor</h2>
    <p>This page was created to using html and CSS showing my Name, role and lists of tasks completed. It informs
        what I have contributed and completed in the the website including what I am responsible for.

    <h2>Website Name and Logo</h2>
    <p>I created the logo of the website myself as well as the name of the website. I also used CSS and html to place the logo, with the Name,
        inside the navigation bar and adjusted it to fit the styling and sizing of the navigation bar.
